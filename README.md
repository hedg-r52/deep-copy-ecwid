# deep-copy-ecwid

Solution of the task that described [here](https://github.com/Ecwid/new-job/blob/master/Deep-clone.md)

Main description: You should implement method that make a deep copy of any class without using of Serializable and Clonable hacks, only abilities of J2SE should be using

Some details:
  - The method should work first of all correctly, and only then quickly.
  - You can only use the features of the standard J2SE library
  - Use Java 11 or higher

P.S. Task contains a description that it should have main() method, but I had neglected it, because in my opinion test methods more talkative and useful
